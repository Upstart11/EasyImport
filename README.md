An addon to simplify and speed up the import of popular file extesions like FBX and OBJ

If you ever had to import a lot of assets in blender you know how painful and frustrating it can be. While we wait for drag and drop import you can try this addon.

This is an addon for Blender which allows you to import fbx and obj files by their paths.

.

Features:

Importing .fbx and .obj files by having their paths in the clipboard

Batch import all .fbx and obj files from a folder by having folder's path in the clipboard

How it Works

First of all you you need to copy file or folder path to clipboard. For the folder you could just copy path from address bar of explorer. To get the file path you can press CTRL+Shift+C(if you are on Windows11 or using Files2)

or any other methods.

After you have the path in the clipboard go to blender window and press CTRL+Shift+V it will import that file in your blender scene or in the case of a folder path it will import all .fbx and .obj file from that folder
